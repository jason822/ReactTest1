## OVERVIEW

What am I going to show you from this simple test project? <br/>
1: Structuring project with presentational components and container components <br/>
2: Using purecomponent to do shallow comparison <br/>
3: Functional components(stateless, statefull) <br/>
4: Using Reselect selectors to get values from a store <br/>
5: Router (For best practice) <br/>
6: SCSS <br/>
7: Moduling <br/>
8: Theme configuration (For best practice) <br/>
9: Loading transition <br/>
10: Simple jest unit test for reducer function <br/>
<br/>
To be honest, Redux is not needed exactly to this so simple project. <br/>
